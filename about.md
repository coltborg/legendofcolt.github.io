My name is Colt, and I am a bearded, cheeky web developer with a yearning for creativity. I traded in my long hair and guitar for glasses and a computer, and haven’t looked back since. I’m a naturally curious being, with a funny personality and a high metabolism. If you’ve been thinking “resistance is futile” this whole time, then we will get along just fine.

I’m from Texas, so I can shoot just about anything: guns, arrows, or the breeze. I played in a jazz band and a metal band at the same time for three years. I use YouTube to keep up to date. When I am not on YouTube, I build websites, and freelance in my spare time. Questions? Comments? Concerns? Job offers? Hit me up on social media!
