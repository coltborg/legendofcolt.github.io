Good morning internet. This is the first post of my personal blog! It’s always hard for me to finish off personal projects. So I’ve made it a point to get this site up so that I can start sharing things I learn. 

My name is Colt Borg, I’m a front end web developer and I just moved to Chicago from the Lone Star State. I work remotely and have been teaching myself different web technologies over the past year and a half.

I started off taking an online web development class while I was in high school. Fast forward several years and after college I relearned HTML5 and CSS3. From there, I’m mostly been doing WordPress development. 

I’d say that JavaScript is my weakest language currently, so I’m doing [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/legendofcolt) to improve. I’m also about to finish up a [Meteor class in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development/). I really enjoy building quick ideas in [Codepen](http://codepen.io/legendofcolt/), so I’ll probably be posting a lot of examples from there here.
